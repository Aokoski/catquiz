Timed quiz about cats
I've been having some issues since I updated my mac to os catalina. I had everything ready to go but then I got things mixed up between github desktop and github. Anyways, this is the 4th repo Ive created so all of my earlier commits are gone>
I recently installed os catalina, and I think I may have to reintstall my tools or something cause I cant get anything to show on githup pages now, except for the readme. My quiz actually turned out pretty awesome. Theres a timer, a progress gauge, and some cool cat facts, so please check it out in vscode then open in a browser.
