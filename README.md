Timed quiz about cats
I've been having some issues since I updated my mac to os catalina. I had everything ready to go but then I got things mixed up between github desktop and github. Anways this is the 4th repo Ive created so all of my earlier commits are gone>
I recently installed os catalina, and I think I may have to reintstall my tools or something cause I get anything to show on githup pages now.
